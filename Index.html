<h2>MY GOALS</h2><!--This is my h2 heading-->
<P>My first goal is that i want to be a professional developer who is known all over the world. To be a developer there is 
  a man whom i admire and motivated me a lot called <strong>simondev</strong> who actually make many videos on youtube so if you want you can bypass there also.
</P>
<p>Beimg a developer is not easy because sometimes you have to master the codes,know diffrent coming techinologies around the world because everyday techinology in tech-development is 
  changing every day so you have to be informed with every thing changing in the industry.
